# Python-University-Chatbot
In this project, a university chatbot has been developed (on python 3.6) specifically for the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD). The chatbot can aid students who are interested in joining UOWD, as well as current UOWD students. The chatbot can offer support by suggesting appropriate majors/programs based on grades and interests; answering general university related questions; informing students on exam and event schedules. The algorithm is based on a simple feed-forward neural network with two fully connected hidden layers and a fully connected Softmax layer. The framework first has conversational intents defined (with a JSON file) and then transformed to a Tensorflow model.
